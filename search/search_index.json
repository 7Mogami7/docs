            "text": "What is RetroAchievements.org?\n\n\nRetroAchievements.org\n is a community who collaborate and compete to earn custom-made achievements in classic games through emulation. Achievements are made by and for the community. We provide various custom-built emulators for you to use which will detect when you have completed various challenges. Once logged in, the emulators will post the achievements you've completed back to the site, so you can check and compare your progress to your friends.\n\n\nHere's an example of RAGens, playing Streets of Rage 2. You will see two leaderboard attempt counters (bottom-right), one achievement popping and finally the overlay (press ESC):\n\n\n\n\nWhich emulator do I need to use?\n\n\nThe official RetroAchievements.org emulators are all Windows-based. For other Operational Systems you can use RetroArch. More information below:\n\n\nOfficial RetroAchievements.org emulators\n\n\nPlease download the emulator of your choice from \nthe download page\n, log in using your username and password, then load a ROM and play! See the following video for a demonstration:\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKY2mZjurJw\n\n\nHow do I access the Achievement Overlay?\n\n\nNormally, this will be set up on 'ESC' keyboard key, or the pause function in the game. In most emulators, a game must be active for it to be functional.\n\n\nSome of the emulators should already be setup assigning a controller button to view the achievement overlay. Generally ESC on the keyboard should activate it, but if you want to assign it to a controller, see \nthis link\n.\n\n\nRetroArch emulators\n\n\nFor non-Windows Operational Systems you need to use \nRetroArch\n.\n\n\nCurrently you can earn achievements via RetroArch on the following platforms:\n\n\n\n\nWindows\n\n\nLinux\n\n\nMac\n\n\nAndroid (yes! you can earn cheevos on-the-go with your Android phone!)\n\n\nPS Vita (needs to be hacked with \nHENkaku\n)\n\n\nWii U (needs to be hacked)\n\n\nRaspberry Pi (recommended systems: \nRetroPie\n, \nlakka\n and \nRecalBox\n\n\n\n\nYou can \nget RetroArch here\n.\n\n\nOnce you installed and did the initial configuration, follow this guide to setup Achievements: \nhttps://buildbot.libretro.com/.docs/guides/retroachievements/\n\n\nKeep in mind that not every RetroArch core is compatible with RetroAchievements. \nCheck this list to see wich one to choose\n.\n\n\nMy welcome email has gone missing!\n\n\nUnfortunately sometimes the welcome email has been known to go missing. If this happens, please log in with your username/password you registered with, then visit your settings page. At the top you'll find the option to resend your registration email.\n\n\nWhere can I find ROMs?\n\n\nNot here. Unfortunately it is illegal to host or distribute copyright ROMs. To extract the ROM file from your cartridges, you can use a tool such as the Retrode or similar, then you can use the ROM file with our emulators. Other websites host ROM files that you could use with our emulators, but we do not condone downloading or playing ROMs for games you do not own.\n\n\nWhy is my game not loading up achievement?\n\n\nEither:\n\n\n\n\nIt doesn't have achievements,\n\n\nYou have the incorrect rom.\n\n\n\n\nFor more details read here: \nhttp://retroachievements.org/viewtopic.php?t=5422\nc=27355\n\n\nIf you are a Linux user, you can use this tool to check if your ROM is OK for RetroAchievements: \nhttps://github.com/meleu/hascheevos\n\n\nWhat is hardcore mode?\n\n\nHardcore mode is an additional feature to separate out the good gamers from the great gamers: Hardcore mode disables \nall\n savestate ability in the emulator: you would not be able to save and reload at any time. You would have to complete the game and get the achievements first time, just like it were on the original console. In reward for this, you will earn both the standard and the hardcore achievement, in effect earning double points! A regular game worth 400 points, is now worth 800 if you complete it fully on hardcore! For example: if you complete the game fully for 400 points, you then have the opportunity to earn another 400 on hardcore.\n\n\nThis achievement didn't trigger! (or triggered at a wrong time)\n\n\nThere's a feature built-in to the emulators that allows you to report broken achievements that occur at the wrong time, or not at all. Go to the RetroAchievements -\n Report Broken Achievements.\n\n\nSee this example:\n\n\n.\n\n\nThere's also a detailed video explaining how to use it: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTHbm700Y-Y\n\n\nAdd details of the state of your game, when it triggered/didn't trigger, what game mode, where you were when it happened/didn't happen, if you had reset the game recently, anything else you think may be relevant to the achievement. This is necessary for our system so the devs know where there is a problem.\n\n\nIf you have an evidence of completion you can also contact an admin and the achievement can be manually awarded to you. Make proof and post in the \n#help-me\n in \nDiscord\n the tag @admin. Or send a PM (personal message) to an admin level user.\n\n\nQualified proof:\n Screenshots that show that one is playing in hardcore and have completed the achievment. \nVideo of such (even better)\n. Examples of achievements you've earned that supersede this achievment, e.g. You got the achievment for 10k points but the one for 5k points didn't trigger.\n\n\nHere's a \nperfect example of ideal proof provided by gr1nya\n.\n\n\nI want to make achievements!\n\n\nGood to hear!\n The best place to start is here: \nGetting Started as an Achievement Developer\n. Once you're familiar with the Memory Inspector and the other Achievements related dialogs, you can go to other \nDeveloper Docs\n.\n\n\nPlease don't hesitate to ask if you need help, don't struggle! The most important thing is to make sure you're enjoying whatever it is you're doing. If you're not having fun, don't do it. But if you get frustrated and want to persist, just drop a message on the \nforums\n or in \nDiscord server\n and someone will get back to you shortly.\n\n\nWhat are the White points?\n\n\nWhite points are secondary based on how hard an achievement is. Explained \nhere in detail\n.\n\n\nWhat's considered cheating (for hardcore)? What if I find evidence of a cheater?\n\n\nAll cheats are disallowed unless it's specified in the achievement's description or comments in the achievement's page. Even ingame cheats, those that already exists on the original console, are considered cheating if not specified.\n\n\nWe live by an honor code most of all. If you find an evidence of a cheater, send the evidence to an active admin member.\n\n\nHow do I reset my password?\n\n\nRight Here:\n\nhttp://retroachievements.org/resetPassword.php",

            "text": "Welcome to the world of Achievement Creation!\n\n\nBasic Concepts\n\n\nTechnically \nan achievement is a group of conditions that must be met in a particular frame of the video game\n.\n\n\nWhen you launch a game on an emulator with the RetroAchievements feature, the emulator is always checking if those conditions are met in the current frame. When all conditions for a particular achievement are met, it is awarded and the emulator stops checking the conditions for that achievement.\n\n\nThe process of creating an achievement basically involves 3 steps:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinding a place in the game's RAM where the information you want is stored (examples: level, life bar, time, coins, holding a weapon, get an item, etc.).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate conditions that must be met in order to award an Achievement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest if your achievement is working as expected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost likely you'll go back to step 2 and 3 many times to refine the logic of your Achievement.\n\n\nIn this doc we'll see how to accomplish the steps above.\n\n\nAfter you're sure your achievement is triggering at the conditions you want, you can submit it to the server. We'll see more about it later.\n\n\nFirst Steps\n\n\nBefore start ensure you have an RA emulator from the \nRetroAchievements Download Page\n first and \ncreate an account\n so you can log in using the emulator.\n\n\nIn this guide we'll be using RAGens to demonstrate, and the game \nSonic the Hedgehog\n. We are using RAGens but the same applies for the other emulators.\n\n\nTo begin, run the RAGens executable, and login when prompted. Next, use File -\n Open and select whatever ROM you would like to find achievements for.\n\n\nMemory Inspector\n\n\nYou should now have your main window running Sonic. There are 3 other dialogs we'll be using, which can be found under \nRetroAchievements\n in the menu. We'll be dealing with the \nMemory Inspector\n first:\n\n\n\n\nThe Memory Inspector can be used to find addresses in RAM for us to use. Essentially you are on a treasure hunt for memory locations - this dialog will help you examine and filter the game's RAM while the game is running. If you want a step-by-step video explanation on finding memory addresses, \nthis video\n can be very useful.\n\n\nTo start or restart a test, click \nNew 8-bit Test\n near the top middle.\n\n\nTo keep things simple, we'll start by looking for the memory address which holds the number of rings we have collected. Our steps will be the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoad the ROM and start a new game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReset the memory dialog: click \nNew 8-bit Test\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturn to the game and change the number of rings in memory. For example, collect a ring.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the memory dialog, we now want to filter for values that are 'greater than previous values' (symbol \n). We select this, then hit \nFilter\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach time you perform 3 then 4, the number of possibilities or 'candidates' will get smaller. We will continue doing this until the number of candidates reaches a very small number (as few as possible), it might take 4-5 attempts. Next we can click in the results window, and monitor the memory address in the memory viewer at the bottom. Continue using the game and you should see the values in memory change as you collect rings. If you don't, or if something doesn't look right, try another value. With the first Sonic the Hedgehog, the memory address for the number of rings should be \n0xfe20\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n: Using save states (F5 to save state, F8 to load state, F6-F7 to toggle which state to use), you can switch back and forth between different states allowing you to alter what is in RAM, and use this to filter out bad candidates. You can search for values that remain the same (I.e. If you know the value didn't change, use \n=\n), or values that are different (use 'not equal', symbol \n!=\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n: There's unfortunately no guarantee from game to game on how the developers have stored their data (4-bit, 8-bit, 16-bit, binary-coded decimals, negative/inverted, i.e. using 0xff/0xffff to represent 'set', or plain randomly), but eventually you should come across some good address. Note if you are struggling to find good values, post \nRetroAchievements.org Development Help forum\n, or \nRetroAchievements Discord server\n. There are plenty of people who will be very happy to help!!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n: if you'd like to experiment with memory, try entering new values directly into the RAM viewer. This can have devastating effects on the game, or it might do exactly what you expect, (or nothing at all!) It can be useful though, to see if you can enter a value and get the result you expect. Use with caution!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you've found an address you're happy with, you can write a short note for what it is and hit \nSave Note\n, this will store it on database, and will be automatically restored next time you load up the memory viewer for this game, wherever you are! Note that after clicking 'Save Note', the note will be automatically stored on the database, and shared so all developers will share access to these memory notes. They will all be downloaded afresh when you load a ROM. If you try to overwrite a note, it will check with you first before submitting.\n\n\nYou can find more useful \nMemory Digging Tips here\n.\n\n\nAchievement Sets\n\n\nOK so the memory location for the number of rings is stored at \n0xfe20\n - note to a non-programmer, we're dealing in \nhexadecimal numeral system\n which can be daunting, but don't worry, essentially its just numbers and letters instead of only numbers, and not forgetting \n0x\n at the start to show that it's a memory location in hex. We've found an address we're interested in and stored it using \nSave Note\n. We now want to create a new achievement.\n\n\nGo to the \nRetroAchievements\n in the menu, choose \nAchievement Sets\n and you'll see this dialog:\n\n\n\n\nHere we group all the achievements we know about into three sets:\n1. Core Achievements (the main, public Achievement set),\n2. Unofficial/User Achievements (public, but will not award you points: for peer review),\n3. Local Achievements (personal to your PC).\n\n\nIn the Achievements dialog, click \nLocal Achievements\n (top left), then \nAdd New Achievement\n (bottom left). This will add a blank entry to the list in the center. Double click on it: if it's not already open, this should select it and open the \nAchievement Editor\n dialog.\n\n\nAchievement Editor\n\n\nThis is how it looks:\n\n\n\n\nThis is the final dialog where we bring all the data together. Most of the top fields are self explanatory, I.e. Title, Description, Points. The main one is the 'Requirements' part.\n\n\nLet's say we want to add an achievement for collecting a certain number of rings. Let's say 15 rings for simplicity. After filling out the fields at the top and selecting a suitable icon (in this example we used the gold trophy badge (00136), but you can upload a new one), we need to fill out Requirements. We have one requirement, \nthat the number of rings is at least 15\n. Next click is \nAdd New Requirement\n.\n\n\nClicking this button will add several default values to the Requirements list. These defaults just ensure that something relatively sensible is added to the list. For now, ignoring the field 'Special?'. When we clicked create, the default memory value will be whatever value you last left in the memory dialog.\n\n\nNext we will change these values to the following:\n\n\n\n\nSize\n: \n16-bit\n\n\nMemory\n: \n0xfe20\n\n\nCmp\n: \n=\n - this is the comparison to make. We could have any comparison here, but it's sensible to have \"greater than or equal to\". This is important because if we get 10 rings then a super ring box to have 20, we would miss out having \nexactly\n 15 rings.\n\n\nType\n: \nValue\n - we're comparing this memory value to a fixed value: 15\n\n\nSize\n: \nEmpty\n - this is only relevant when comparing memory to memory\n\n\nMem/Val\n: \n15\n - the number of rings required: the value we are comparing the memory to\n\n\nHit Count\n: \n0\n - ignore this for now, its useful for when something needs to happen a certain number of times\n\n\n\n\nWith that set, we don't have any more conditions to add, so we return to the \nAchievements Dialog\n. To be safe, we should save our progress by hitting \nSave Local\n! This saves everything to file locally to ensure that we won't lose any progress.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n: usually achievements have more than one requirement to avoid it triggering in a wrong time (i.e. playing demo mode). In this example we are using only one requirement just to simplify the explanation. See more \nAchievement Creation Tips here\n.\n\n\n\n\nTesting the Achievement\n\n\nWe can now 'activate' this achievement locally by hitting \nActivate\n on the right-hand side. This will start monitoring these memory locations and will award the achievement once all the conditions are true. Now we can go ahead and test to see if this achievement works!\n\n\n\n\nIf we press ESCAPE in-game, you will see the achievement show up as a demonstration of what it would look like in the in-game overlay!\n\n\n\n\nOK, the Achievement works. Now What?\n\n\nOnce we have tested that the achievement works locally, there is a two-step commit process:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst in the Achievements Dialog, we select our achievement and press \nCommit Selected\n, and agree to the dialog.

            "text": "Technically  an achievement is a group of conditions that must be met in a particular frame of the video game .  When you launch a game on an emulator with the RetroAchievements feature, the emulator is always checking if those conditions are met in the current frame. When all conditions for a particular achievement are met, it is awarded and the emulator stops checking the conditions for that achievement.  The process of creating an achievement basically involves 3 steps:    Finding a place in the game's RAM where the information you want is stored (examples: level, life bar, time, coins, holding a weapon, get an item, etc.).    Create conditions that must be met in order to award an Achievement.    Test if your achievement is working as expected.    Most likely you'll go back to step 2 and 3 many times to refine the logic of your Achievement.  In this doc we'll see how to accomplish the steps above.  After you're sure your achievement is triggering at the conditions you want, you can submit it to the server. We'll see more about it later.",

We'll be dealing with the  Memory Inspector  first:   The Memory Inspector can be used to find addresses in RAM for us to use. Essentially you are on a treasure hunt for memory locations - this dialog will help you examine and filter the game's RAM while the game is running. If you want a step-by-step video explanation on finding memory addresses,  this video  can be very useful.  To start or restart a test, click  New 8-bit Test  near the top middle.  To keep things simple, we'll start by looking for the memory address which holds the number of rings we have collected. Our steps will be the following:    Load the ROM and start a new game.    Reset the memory dialog: click  New 8-bit Test .    Return to the game and change the number of rings in memory. For example, collect a ring.    In the memory dialog, we now want to filter for values that are 'greater than previous values' (symbol  ). We select this, then hit  Filter .    Each time you perform 3 then 4, the number of possibilities or 'candidates' will get smaller. We will continue doing this until the number of candidates reaches a very small number (as few as possible), it might take 4-5 attempts. Next we can click in the results window, and monitor the memory address in the memory viewer at the bottom. Continue using the game and you should see the values in memory change as you collect rings. If you don't, or if something doesn't look right, try another value. With the first Sonic the Hedgehog, the memory address for the number of rings should be  0xfe20 .    Note : Using save states (F5 to save state, F8 to load state, F6-F7 to toggle which state to use), you can switch back and forth between different states allowing you to alter what is in RAM, and use this to filter out bad candidates. You can search for values that remain the same (I.e. If you know the value didn't change, use  = ), or values that are different (use 'not equal', symbol  != ).    Note : There's unfortunately no guarantee from game to game on how the developers have stored their data (4-bit, 8-bit, 16-bit, binary-coded decimals, negative/inverted, i.e. using 0xff/0xffff to represent 'set', or plain randomly), but eventually you should come across some good address. Note if you are struggling to find good values, post  RetroAchievements.org Development Help forum , or  RetroAchievements Discord server . There are plenty of people who will be very happy to help!!    Tip : if you'd like to experiment with memory, try entering new values directly into the RAM viewer. This can have devastating effects on the game, or it might do exactly what you expect, (or nothing at all!) It can be useful though, to see if you can enter a value and get the result you expect. Use with caution!    When you've found an address you're happy with, you can write a short note for what it is and hit  Save Note , this will store it on database, and will be automatically restored next time you load up the memory viewer for this game, wherever you are! Note that after clicking 'Save Note', the note will be automatically stored on the database, and shared so all developers will share access to these memory notes. They will all be downloaded afresh when you load a ROM. If you try to overwrite a note, it will check with you first before submitting.  You can find more useful  Memory Digging Tips here .",

After filling out the fields at the top and selecting a suitable icon (in this example we used the gold trophy badge (00136), but you can upload a new one), we need to fill out Requirements. We have one requirement,  that the number of rings is at least 15 . Next click is  Add New Requirement .  Clicking this button will add several default values to the Requirements list. These defaults just ensure that something relatively sensible is added to the list. For now, ignoring the field 'Special?'. When we clicked create, the default memory value will be whatever value you last left in the memory dialog.  Next we will change these values to the following:   Size :  16-bit  Memory :  0xfe20  Cmp :  =  - this is the comparison to make. We could have any comparison here, but it's sensible to have \"greater than or equal to\". This is important because if we get 10 rings then a super ring box to have 20, we would miss out having  exactly  15 rings.  Type :  Value  - we're comparing this memory value to a fixed value: 15  Size :  Empty  - this is only relevant when comparing memory to memory  Mem/Val :  15  - the number of rings required: the value we are comparing the memory to  Hit Count :  0  - ignore this for now, its useful for when something needs to happen a certain number of times   With that set, we don't have any more conditions to add, so we return to the  Achievements Dialog . To be safe, we should save our progress by hitting  Save Local ! This saves everything to file locally to ensure that we won't lose any progress.

The reason for this is that the genesis is locked into processing 60 frames of logic per second (NTSC at least?). And the fact we're looking for is \"speed is over 300\". Also, we want the player to keep the speed above 300 without pausing the game.\n\n\nConditions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplayer's speed is above 300 for 600 frames (or 10 seconds have passed).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nreset the hit counter if speed is under 300.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nreset the hit counter if the player pause the game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDelta Values and \nResetIf\n\n\nLet's take \nStreets of Rage 2 (Mega Drive)\n\nas a case study, and \nSteel Grip - Defeat 10 enemies without dropping your weapon\n achievement.

We require this to be true, once. This is actually not necessary, but it's useful to show the progression. We are saying that require the player to hold a weapon, at least once.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnumber of KOs that the player has made. It's 16-bit (meaning the value can be more than 255), and by using the delta and 'greater than' symbols, we are saying that we require the number of KOs to be bigger than the previous value, and we need this to happen 10 unique times. Every time the current value is bigger than the previous value, the hit count will go up by one. The next frame, the 'delta' value will have increased to be the same as the current value, this ensures that after every kill, the KO counter will go up by one, and the hit count will go up by one. \nLIMITATION\n: if the number of KOs goes up by two in the same frame, the hit count will only go up by one. It's a slight flaw that does happen a little more often than expected... it's not so accurate but it's a fairly close estimate to your number of kills.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nreset all our progress, if the \nweapon type\n is different to the last known weapon type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nreset \nall\n our progress, if the player is no longer carrying a weapon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of how to avoid load state abusing\n\n\nIn this example the game is \nZooming Secretary (NES)\n, and the Achievement is \nGreat Job! - Now you can take a rest\n, for beating the game.\n\n\nIn this example the developer wants to make sure the player went through all levels to beat the game in order to earn the achievement.

This way a player can't just start the game, load a state to go directly to the last level and then beat the game. He/she needs to go through all levels.\n\n\nThe \nResetIf\n is here just to avoid the case where the player keep loading states going back and forth between levels making the hit counter to be 8.

Also, we want the player to keep the speed above 300 without pausing the game.

It's 16-bit (meaning the value can be more than 255), and by using the delta and 'greater than' symbols, we are saying that we require the number of KOs to be bigger than the previous value, and we need this to happen 10 unique times. Every time the current value is bigger than the previous value, the hit count will go up by one. The next frame, the 'delta' value will have increased to be the same as the current value, this ensures that after every kill, the KO counter will go up by one, and the hit count will go up by one.  LIMITATION : if the number of KOs goes up by two in the same frame, the hit count will only go up by one. It's a slight flaw that does happen a little more often than expected... it's not so accurate but it's a fairly close estimate to your number of kills.    reset all our progress, if the  weapon type  is different to the last known weapon type.    reset  all  our progress, if the player is no longer carrying a weapon.",

            "text": "This doc has some suggestions about difficulty, set balance and on keeping a set fun, approachable, and challenging. What you're going to see here are not rules, just suggestions.\n\n\nNote\n: be aware of \nDevelopers Code of Conduct\n\n\nDifficulty Scale:\n\n\n\n\nFreebie\n\n\nEasy\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nMed-hard\n\n\nHard\n\n\nVery-Hard\n\n\nSuper-Hard\n\n\n\n\nMore details on these \nat the bottom\n.\n\n\nIn general there should be an steady sloping balance of difficulty. One should think of the overall difficulty of a set while building it. One should not make sets excessively difficult.\n\n\nA good set balance on a 50 cheeves in an average set would have roughly: 4 freebies, 6 easy cheeves, 10 medium, 10 med-hard, 14 hard, and 6 very-hard, 0 kaizo.\n\n\nA well balanced difficulty distribution has rewards for every type of player. It gives each skill level something to accomplish until mastery.\n\n\nAchievements should not just be a check-mark of completing a game\n, (too easy) but create fun new memories for the game (diversity of challenges).\n\n\nIt leaves space for freebies that are featuring curious or fun elements of the game. It expects enough difficulty that once you've mastered the set you are a master of the game. But it doesn't ask too much from the player either.\n\n\nIt also shouldn't ask the player to be doing seemingly endless repetitive grinding to make a set seem harder. Doing the same task over and over isn't hard, it's typically dull. It should almost always avoid making marathon types with a hill at the end (ones that require long setup times with low or repetitive difficulty and then a spike of high difficulty at the end. Don't do it!).\n\n\nSets should be mastereable by a skilled player who gives a dedicated effort.\n\n\nSets should reflect the content of the game. Grinding cheeves in games that require grinding are reasonable, where in other places they would often be inappropriate.\n\n\nSets should also break out of just what is expected from a game, pushing the player to need to find new solutions for problems a veteran player never considered.\n\n\nSet Quantity:\n\n\nSet quantity should not have such hard rules. Quality is the key factor.\n\n\nThe set quantity strongly depends on how much fun and challenges the game can give. That's why the set developer must know the game very well.\n\n\nSet Variety:\n\n\nKeep it fun, give it variety, challenge the player, give the player new things to do.\n\n\nSome achievements can give much fun to the player when they are like a meta-game. Where the player is required to rethink the game entirely.\n\n\nSome notable examples:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFabulous ComboFabulous Combo (15)\n - it turns the game into a puzzle game, completing this can be really satifying\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSwordless Adventurer (20)\n - with no sword you are forced to rethink the entire game. You can discover how useful all the subweapons are. Very fun!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere Are No Bullets in the Energy Zone (10)\n - pacifist challenges, when possible force a lot more agility from the player and break old habits. Very fun!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinitions of Difficulty\n\n\n0 - freebie\n\n\nTakes almost no effort for basically all players to achieve this OR the player gets it without any conscious effort. The player gets these on accident and they pop up on the screen. Sometimes the player will have no idea why they earned them. Some freebies are good some are bad.\n\n\nExamples:\n Starting the game, picking a character, collecting an easily accessible item, killing your first enemy. Stumbling on a cheeve that took no forethought but highlights elements of the game.\n\n\n1 - Easy\n\n\nMost players could get these on their first attempt, Some on their second or third attempt. Rarely players can mess it up.\n\n\nExamples:\n Progress on easy stages, getting 100 coins, collecting a feather, collecting 20 rings. Getting the first upgrade, getting to a well known secret stage. Fighting a simple boss: most bosses in Super Mario World, completing early stages in Sonic.\n\n\n2 - Medium\n\n\nMany players could get this on their first attempt. Many could after a few attempts. Some will need to practice. Very few will struggle with them.\n\n\nExamples:\n Getting all the colored switches in Super Mario World, collecting all of the items in a Castlevania stage, getting a bonus item in a more hidden area, like moons in SMW. Beating Contra with the Konami code.\n\n\n3 - Medium-Hard\n\n\nA low amount of players could get this on their first attempt. Some after a few attempts and most will take some effort and practice to complete these. A few will find them very challenging, and give up.\n\n\nExamples:\n Getting some of the chaos emeralds in Sonic 2. Beating Super Mario World.\n\n\n4 - Hard\n\n\nVery few player can get these on their first attempt, perhaps if they already know the game (not really a first attempt is it?) Most can complete these with a solid effort, many attempts and some practice, and some need to practice other games first.\n\n\nExamples:\n Getting all of the Chaos emeralds in Sonic 1,2,3. Beating Contra without the Konami code.\n\n\n5 - Very Hard\n\n\nOnly the rarest of players can complete these on a first attempt. Most can complete it after many attempts, Many players will drop off here and won't be willing to complete the set unless they are completionists or fans of the game.

One should think of the overall difficulty of a set while building it. One should not make sets excessively difficult.  A good set balance on a 50 cheeves in an average set would have roughly: 4 freebies, 6 easy cheeves, 10 medium, 10 med-hard, 14 hard, and 6 very-hard, 0 kaizo.  A well balanced difficulty distribution has rewards for every type of player. It gives each skill level something to accomplish until mastery.  Achievements should not just be a check-mark of completing a game , (too easy) but create fun new memories for the game (diversity of challenges).  It leaves space for freebies that are featuring curious or fun elements of the game. It expects enough difficulty that once you've mastered the set you are a master of the game. But it doesn't ask too much from the player either.  It also shouldn't ask the player to be doing seemingly endless repetitive grinding to make a set seem harder. Doing the same task over and over isn't hard, it's typically dull. It should almost always avoid making marathon types with a hill at the end (ones that require long setup times with low or repetitive difficulty and then a spike of high difficulty at the end. Don't do it!).  Sets should be mastereable by a skilled player who gives a dedicated effort.  Sets should reflect the content of the game. Grinding cheeves in games that require grinding are reasonable, where in other places they would often be inappropriate.  Sets should also break out of just what is expected from a game, pushing the player to need to find new solutions for problems a veteran player never considered.",

            "text": "Currently Leaderboards can be edited by developers on the website. It's a pretty hefty interface and a difficult job to get a leaderboard working just right. It genuinely takes some care and attention to get a good leaderboard working, so in this doc we'll try to understand how it works.\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nThis is how a game's Leaderboard List looks like on the website:\n\n\n\n\nIn the center you can see every already made Leaderboard, and in the right column you can see the \nCode Notes\n for the game. The Code Notes are here to help with some conditions we'll see below.\n\n\nHere's a brief explanation of each field of a single Leaderboard:\n\n\n\n\nTitle\n: the leaderboard's title.\n\n\nDescription\n: the leaderboard's description.\n\n\nFormat\n: it can be \nScore\n, \nTime (Frames)\n, \nTime (Milliseconds)\n or \nValue\n. It's used to distinguish what sort of leaderboard this is (we'll go into this below).\n\n\n\"LowerIsBetter\" checkbox\n: when checked, it means that a lower value is a better thing. It's usually the case for time based leaderboards, whereas a larger score generally is better.\n\n\nStart\n: start conditions, aka \nSTA\n.\n\n\nCancel\n: cancel conditions, aka \nCAN\n.\n\n\nSubmit\n: submit conditions, aka \nSUB\n.\n\n\nValue\n: a value interpreter, aka \nVAL\n.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n: A valid leaderboard MUST have all four of these conditions.\n\n\nThose last 4 fields are really important and \nLOTS\n of care must be taken over the entry of any characters into these strings. That's why they deserve a further explanation:\n\n\nThe \nSTA\n or \nStart\n condition is a series of values, like an achievement, that must be true in order to start looking for a leaderboard submission. Once the \nSTA\n is true, the game will activate the other three, and will keep processing them constantly.\n\n\nIf a \nCancel\n (\nCAN\n) condition is true, then it will cancel all progress towards the leaderboard submission. If however the \nSubmit\n (\nSUB\n) condition is true, then the leaderboard entry will be submitted.\n\n\nFinally, the \nValue\n (\nVAL\n) is a special case, and will be taken from memory using the formula stated in the memory box.\n\n\nAddress Format\n\n\nThe memory addresses for STA/CAN/SUB/VAL have the following format:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlocation/size\n\n\nprefix (the letters can be in lower case)\n\n\nexample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbit0\n\n\n0xM\n\n\n0xM01234\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbit1\n\n\n0xN\n\n\n0xN01234\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbit2\n\n\n0xO\n\n\n0xO01234\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbit3\n\n\n0xP\n\n\n0xP01234\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbit4\n\n\n0xQ\n\n\n0xQ01234\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbit5\n\n\n0xR\n\n\n0xR01234\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbit6\n\n\n0xS\n\n\n0xS01234\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbit7\n\n\n0xT\n\n\n0xT01234\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLower4\n\n\n0xL\n\n\n0xL01234\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpper4\n\n\n0xU\n\n\n0xU01234\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8bit\n\n\n0xH\n\n\n0xH01234\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16bit\n\n\n0x\n\n\n0x01234\n\n\n\n\n\n\n32bit\n\n\n0xX\n\n\n0xX01234\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nThe best place to start is to look at one of the existing leaderboards \nhttp://retroachievements.org/leaderboardList.php\n and break it down to see how it works. We're going to use the \nGreen Hill Act 1 (Sonic the Hedgehog) Leaderboard\n for this purpose. Then let's see how it looks:\n\n\n\n\nThe \nTitle/Description\n fields are quite obvious.\n\n\nThe \nType\n is \"Time (Frames)\". In Sonic every 60 frames is 1 second, then we'll monitor the time using the frames.\n\n\nThe \nLower Is Better\n flag is checked, then the one who makes the shortest time will be the #1.\n\n\nNow we're going to break down the most important parts.\n\n\nStart Conditions\n\n\nSTA\n: \n0xfe10=h0000_0xhf601=h0c_d0xhf601!=h0c_0xfff0=0\n\n\n\n\n0xfe10=h0000\n: If RAM address 0xfe10 is equivalent to hex 0000,\n\n\n_\n: AND,\n\n\n0xhf601=h0c\n: If 8-bit RAM address 0xf601 is equivalent to hex 0c,\n\n\n_\n: AND,\n\n\nd0xhf601!=h0c\n: If the previous 8-bit RAM address 0xf601 is NOT equivalent to hex 0c,\n\n\n_\n: AND,\n\n\n0xfff0=0\n If RAM address 0xfff0 is equivalent to 0.\n\n\n\n\nThis might seem daunting, because we don't know what these addresses mean. That's why the \nCode Notes\n in the right column are pretty handy! You can see how these addresses are labelled in memory. In our example we have:\n\n\n\n\n0xfe10 is the level, and is expected to be 0 (the first level).\n\n\n0xf601 is an 8-bit memory address, and we use the prefix '0xh' instead of '0x' to signify this. 0xf601 is the screen mode. The second and third parts of this start statement are saying 'the current mode should be 'ingame' (0c), and the previous mode should NOT be 'ingame'. Note that 'd' represents delta, or \"the previous frame's value\". In other words, trigger this if we've JUST arrived in a level (the start of the level, when we want to start testing their time).\n\n\nFinally we also expect 0xfff0 to be equivalent to 0, because 0xfff0 is the demo mode, and we don't want to award a leaderboard entry when the demo is active!\n\n\n\n\nCancel Conditions\n\n\nCAN\n: \n0xhfe13\nd0xhfe13\n\n\n\n\n0xfe13 is the number of lives.\n\n\n\n\nThe cancel section checks if the player's LIVES counter ever becomes lower. Literally, it says \"Cancel if the CURRENT value at 0xfe13 is less than the PREVIOUS value at 0xfe13\". We want to do this because you could reach the final checkpoint and run out of time, resetting your timer to 0:00. We don't want to allow this, because it's not the correct way of completing the level. So if the player dies, we reset their leaderboard progress.\n\n\nSubmit Conditions\n\n\nSUB\n: \n0xf7cc!=0_d0xf7cc=0\n\n\n\n\n0xf7cc is the endlevel flag, non-interactive.\n\n\n\n\nThe submit section checks if the current frame has the 'endlevel' flag set to true (or \n!=0\n, 'nonzero'), and the previous frame (delta) has it set to false (or \n=0\n, 'zero'). This suggests that the player has reached the end of the level, and has proven to be a fairly sturdy benchmark.\n\n\nTip\n: it can be useful to watch these values in memory to see how they perform, and what sort of values they end up at in different circumstances.\n\n\nValue Interpreter\n\n\nVAL\n: \n0xhfe24*1_0xhfe25*60_0xhfe22*3600\n\n\nFinally, value. Once the player has reached the start condition, they will be shown a popup which remains on-screen, showing their progress so far. If it's a time leaderboard, it will be a clock, and if it's a score, it will just be the value. If they fulfill the cancel condition, they will be told that they have failed, and the popup will be removed. If they successfully reach the submit condition, the current value will be taken and submitted as their score, and on successful submission, an ingame popup will inform the player of the leaderboard so far, and their position in the leaderboard.\n\n\nThe value condition is special in a few ways. It is evaluated constantly and shown on-screen all the time when the leaderboard is active. It doesn't work like the other conditions, it expects addresses in the following way:\n\n\naddress*modifier\n (address times modifier)\n\n\nand it uses the \n_\n underscore operator as a 'plus'. The \n*\n asterisk signifies 'multiply', so in the value\n\n\n0xhfe24*1_0xhfe25*60_0xhfe22*3600\n\n\nrepresents:\n\n\n8-bit 0xfe24 times 1, PLUS\n8-bit 0xfe25 times 60, PLUS\n8-bit 0xfe22 times 3600\n\n\nThe reason for this is that the values in each of these addresses signifies frames, seconds, and minutes respectively. When we add these values together, we get a grand total in frames that we submit to the database.\n\n\nRemember that 'Format' field that can be either \nScore\n, \nTime (Frames)\n, \nTime (Milliseconds)\n or \nValue\n? \nTime (Frames)\n is the most common one, and represents 'frames'. \nTime (Milliseconds)\n expects a value that we can convert directly into millisecs (Super Mario Kart uses this). However to convert a value in frames into a human-readible format, we should divide the value by 60 to get an accurate representation of seconds, and a value in millisecs should be divided by 100 to get the number of seconds. This is used both on the website and in the app to display the value properly, and is important to distinguish so we can be sure we get the most accurate value out of the emulator, by using whatever format they use to record time.\n\n\nFurther help\n\n\nThere are unfortunately \nMANY\n ways to get this process wrong, so if you are having any trouble feel free to ask for help in our \nDiscord server\n.\n\n\nIf you want to practice, it's highly recommended to create your own leaderboard and attempting something on a new game, rather than using an existing leaderboard.\n\n\nPlease remember that these files are pulled directly into someone's game if they decide to play it, and a badly formed memory address or string could cause their emulator to crash, so please test your leaderboard code!",

It's usually the case for time based leaderboards, whereas a larger score generally is better.  Start : start conditions, aka  STA .  Cancel : cancel conditions, aka  CAN .  Submit : submit conditions, aka  SUB .  Value : a value interpreter, aka  VAL .   Note : A valid leaderboard MUST have all four of these conditions.  Those last 4 fields are really important and  LOTS  of care must be taken over the entry of any characters into these strings. That's why they deserve a further explanation:  The  STA  or  Start  condition is a series of values, like an achievement, that must be true in order to start looking for a leaderboard submission. Once the  STA  is true, the game will activate the other three, and will keep processing them constantly.  If a  Cancel  ( CAN ) condition is true, then it will cancel all progress towards the leaderboard submission. If however the  Submit  ( SUB ) condition is true, then the leaderboard entry will be submitted.  Finally, the  Value  ( VAL ) is a special case, and will be taken from memory using the formula stated in the memory box.",

This might seem daunting, because we don't know what these addresses mean. That's why the  Code Notes  in the right column are pretty handy! You can see how these addresses are labelled in memory. In our example we have:   0xfe10 is the level, and is expected to be 0 (the first level).  0xf601 is an 8-bit memory address, and we use the prefix '0xh' instead of '0x' to signify this. 0xf601 is the screen mode. The second and third parts of this start statement are saying 'the current mode should be 'ingame' (0c), and the previous mode should NOT be 'ingame'. Note that 'd' represents delta, or \"the previous frame's value\". In other words, trigger this if we've JUST arrived in a level (the start of the level, when we want to start testing their time).

If it's a time leaderboard, it will be a clock, and if it's a score, it will just be the value. If they fulfill the cancel condition, they will be told that they have failed, and the popup will be removed. If they successfully reach the submit condition, the current value will be taken and submitted as their score, and on successful submission, an ingame popup will inform the player of the leaderboard so far, and their position in the leaderboard.  The value condition is special in a few ways. It is evaluated constantly and shown on-screen all the time when the leaderboard is active. It doesn't work like the other conditions, it expects addresses in the following way:  address*modifier  (address times modifier)  and it uses the  _  underscore operator as a 'plus'. The  *  asterisk signifies 'multiply', so in the value  0xhfe24*1_0xhfe25*60_0xhfe22*3600  represents:  8-bit 0xfe24 times 1, PLUS\n8-bit 0xfe25 times 60, PLUS\n8-bit 0xfe22 times 3600  The reason for this is that the values in each of these addresses signifies frames, seconds, and minutes respectively. When we add these values together, we get a grand total in frames that we submit to the database.  Remember that 'Format' field that can be either  Score ,  Time (Frames) ,  Time (Milliseconds)  or  Value ?  Time (Frames)  is the most common one, and represents 'frames'.  Time (Milliseconds)  expects a value that we can convert directly into millisecs (Super Mario Kart uses this). However to convert a value in frames into a human-readible format, we should divide the value by 60 to get an accurate representation of seconds, and a value in millisecs should be divided by 100 to get the number of seconds. This is used both on the website and in the app to display the value properly, and is important to distinguish so we can be sure we get the most accurate value out of the emulator, by using whatever format they use to record time.",

To have RP in a game you need a Rich Presence Script \n(RPS)\n which is created by Developers. The Script check the player's game memory and as programmed reports the values of certain addresses with definitions assigned by the Developer such as which stage the player is on, how many lives they have, if the game is paused, what game mode they are playing, what the player has accomplished, etc. This information is reported back to the website. \nEvery game published needs at least a basic RPS.\n\n\n\nExample of RP in action\n\n\nTo see the RP live in a game click on the RetroAchievements menu in your emulator and then click on Rich Presence Monitor. A small window will show you your active RP. (Good for debugging)\n\n\n\n\nThe best way to understand Rich Presence is to look at various examples in game, look at the addresses used and look at how the text is displayed in the Rich Presence Monitor and on site.\n\n\nHow Does it work?\n\n\nEvery time a game is launched, it fetches the achievements in a 'patch' file for the ROM which details all the achievements and memory addresses (and leaderboards) that can be watched for. It will also request a Rich Presence Script for the currently loaded ROM. The emulator will report back to the website every 120 seconds.

More about this later. \n\n\nFormat\n\n\nFormat tables are defined like this:\n\n\nFormat:Score\nFormatType=VALUE\n\n\n\n\nBegin with \nFormat:\n, then the name of the format type. On the next line, give \nFormatType=\n, then one of the following: \nVALUE\n, \nSCORE\n (or \nPOINTS\n), \nTIME\n (or \nFRAMES\n), \nSECS\n, \nMILLISECS\n, or \nOTHER\n. \n\n\n\n\nVALUE\n: generic value, no leading zeroes. \n\n\nSCORE\n/\nPOINTS\n: \"000130 points\" \n\n\nTIME\n/\nFRAMES\n: value describes the number of frames elapsed, and will be turned into 00:00.00 \n\n\nSECS\n: value describes the number of seconds elapsed, and will be turned into 00:00 \n\n\nMILLISECS\n: value describes the number of millisecs elapsed, and will be turned into 00:00.00 \n\n\n\n\nDisplay\n\n\nDisplay will be a string that gets shown in the 'Active Players' box on the front page. It refers to the previously defined Lookup and Format objects using a single '@'. It then specifies a name for the lookup or format (case sensitive!), and immediately after, in brackets, a series of memory values specifying what to send to that lookup or format object.\n\n\n@Powerup(0xh756)\n \n\n\nThis means use the Lookup or Format that's called \nPowerup\n, and give it whatever value is in 0xh756. \n\n\nExample Lookup Breakdown\n\n\n@Mode(0xh770)\n - Lookup for the address that shows if the game is in demo mode or a world has been completed.\n\n\n@Paused(0xh776)\n - Lookup for the address that shows if the game is paused (3 values are used, two of them are for pausing and unpausing).\n\n\n@Star(0xM79f_0xN79f_0xo79f_0xP79f_0xQ79f_0xR79f)\n - Lookup for the address of if Mario has Star invincibility. More on this later.\n\n\n@Powerup(0xh756)\n - Lookup for the address that show if Mairo is Small, big or has fire power.\n\n\nMario in\n - Static text to string lookup and format objects together.\n\n\n@Digit(0xh75f_v1)\n - \nDigit\n is a format object defined as a value. The address 0xh75f is the World minus 1 (because it it 0 based, as in it starts counting at 0). \n_v1\n Means + value 1. \n_v+1\n is also correct.\n\n\n-\n - More static text to split World and Level. as in the hypen in World 1-1.\n\n\n@Digit(0xh75c_v1)\n - Another use of the \nDigit\n format object. This time It's looking up the stage. World 1-X.\n\n@Swimming(0xh704) - Lookup for the address that shows if the player is swimming.\n\n@Status(0xhe) - Lookup for the address that shows Mario's status, such as going through pipes.\n\n\n, \ud83d\udeb6:\n - More static text. \ud83d\udeb6 is a symbol for lives.\n\n\n@Digit(0xh75a_v1)\n - Third use of the \nDigit\n format object. This time it's checking the player lives address.\n\n\n,\n - Static text.\n\n\n@Quest(0xh7fc)\n A lookup to see if the player is in normal or on the 2nd quest, hardmode.\n\n\nQuest\n - Static Text.  \n\n\nAddress size\n\n\nTo specify what size of address you are are checking there are various characters used. (capitalization is ignored)\n\n\nA 16bit address is default and has no character designation. At 0x10 the address is two bytes and 16 bits. \n\nAn 8bit address's character is h (or H). At 0xh10 the address is one byte and 8 bits. \nxxxx xxxx\n\nAn upper4 address's character is u (or U). At 0xu10 the address is one nibble and 4 bits. \nxxxx 0000\n\nA lower4 address's character is l (or L). At 0xl10 the address is one nibble and 4 bits. \n0000 xxxx\n\nA bit0 address's character is m (or M). At 0xm10 the address is one bit, the lowest bit: \n0000 000x\n\nA bit1 address's character is n (or N). At 0xn10 the address is one bit, the second bit: \n0000 00x0\n\nA bit2 address's character is o (or O). At 0xn10 the address is one bit, the third bit: \n0000 0x00\n\nA bit3 address's character is p (or P). At 0xp10 the address is one bit, the fourth bit: \n0000 x000\n\nA bit4 address's character is q (or Q). At 0xq10 the address is one bit, the fifth bit: \n000x 0000\n\nA bit5 address's character is r (or R). At 0xr10 the address is one bit, the sixth bit: \n00x0 0000\n\nA bit6 address's character is s (or S). At 0xs10 the address is one bit, the seventh bit: \n0x00 0000\n\nA bit7 address's character is t (or T). At 0xt10 the address is one bit, the top bit: \n0x00 0000\n\nA 32bit address's character is x (or X). At 0xx10 the address is four bytes and 32 bits.\n\n\n\nAt a glance\n\n\nBinary Coded Decimal (BCD)\n\n\nBCD is when the values are store in an address from as 0-9 (one digit) or 0-99 (two digits). Keep in most often values are stored in hexidecimal, but sometime games will store them in this way and here's the best way to handle these addresses in your display.\n\n\nFor value objects you can use the BCD prefix, as in \nb0x1\n.\nA BCD address is assumed to be 8bit, h is unnecessary but also won't cause problems. Other character prefixes work? (untested).\nWhen you use the b prefix and the address is stored as a BCD your out put for an address that is 10 will be 10 instead of 16 (which is 10 in hex).\n\n\nThis is most commonly used for score and time, but often other types of display values.\n\n\nLimits\n\n\n\n\n2500 character limit for script  \n\n\n100 character limit for what is displayed  \n\n\nUnicode characters are allowed  \n\n\nUsing \n in text will cut off the script after the \n  \n\n\nUsing the character \n+\n Will not display  \n\n\n\n\nSyntax Details\n\n\n\n\nThe RPS ignores trailing 0s in hex address lookups and values 0x00001 == 0x1, 0xh0000245 == 0xh245, 0x0a == 0xa\n\n\nLookup values are Decimal by default and hex if you place the prefix of 0x. This mean 1 == 0x1, 2 == 0x2, 9 == 0x9, 10 == 0xa, 100 == 0x64, etc.  \n\n\n\n\nTips and Tricks\n\n\n\n\nLookups must be case specific with their corresponding @ in the display and not contain spaces after the lookup is defined.\n\n\nLookup names can be as short as a single character if you need to squeeze in a few extra characters.\n\n\nTurning all your values from hex into decimal will take up less characters.\n\n\nUnicode characters don't always \"take up less space\" they often take up to four system characters.\n\n\nIf you do not define your lookups they will be left blank (no space). This is only true for NES, SNES, Gen, RAVBA. N64, Meka and Lynx will leave the word \"Unknown\" each time you don't define a lookup.\n\n\nYou only need one value format object. You can reference it with multiple addresses. (is this always true?)\n\n\nPutting spaces in your lookups sometimes before or after can allow you to hide certain lookups when they are not needed, like how \n@Pause\n, \n@Star\n, \n@Swimming\n, and @Mode do. \n\n\n\n\nValue Properties\n\n\nWhen using lookup and format objects \n@object()\n it's possible to combine and perform calculations. This can be used to correctly display a score, in game time, etc. or make more advanced lookups.\n\n\nExample\n\n\n@Score(0x28*10_0x29*1000_0x26*100000) points\n \n\n\nThis means use the Lookup or Format \nScore\n, and give it the sum of:\n\n- 0x28 times 10, ADD\n\n- 0x29 times 1000, ADD\n\n- 0x26 times 100000  \n\n\n\n\n_\n adds the addresses together.  \n\n\nOr you can add a static value \n0x28_v10\n. This adds 10 to your total, as in whatever the value of \n0x28\n + 10 will be displayed. You can also subtract \n0x28_v-10.\n  \n\n\nIf you'd like to subtract an address you need to multiply the address by -1. \n0x29*-1\n. \n0x29\n is now negative.  \n\n\nIf you'd like to perform division you'll need to multiply by a decimal.  \n0x26*.5\n. \n0x26\n will output 1/2 of the value at \n0x26\n.  \n\n\nAnd you can string everything together: \n0x28*10_0x29*-1_0x26*.625_v-10\n.\n\n\nYou can also add addresses together to give you lookups based on the sums of various addresses. This is used in the example in @Star. It's looking up sum the 6 lowest bits of the address 0xh79f. The way this address works is that so long as there is a value there Mario is invincible star mario and it counts down from hex value 0x23 (35 decimal) to 0. 23 in binary is 0010 0011 meaning the max sum of these bits could 5 during 0001 1111 when the count down reaches hex value 0x1f (31 decimal).\n\n\n\n\nUnicode Standard Symbols\n\n\n\u258c\u258c=Paused\n\n\ud83d\udd01=Loop number\n\n\ud83d\udeb6=Lives.

Unicode characters don't always \"take up less space\" they often take up to four system characters.  If you do not define your lookups they will be left blank (no space). This is only true for NES, SNES, Gen, RAVBA. N64, Meka and Lynx will leave the word \"Unknown\" each time you don't define a lookup.  You only need one value format object.

Or you can add a static value  0x28_v10 . This adds 10 to your total, as in whatever the value of  0x28  + 10 will be displayed. You can also subtract  0x28_v-10.     If you'd like to subtract an address you need to multiply the address by -1.  0x29*-1 .  0x29  is now negative.    If you'd like to perform division you'll need to multiply by a decimal.   0x26*.5 .  0x26  will output 1/2 of the value at  0x26 .    And you can string everything together:  0x28*10_0x29*-1_0x26*.625_v-10 .  You can also add addresses together to give you lookups based on the sums of various addresses. This is used in the example in @Star. It's looking up sum the 6 lowest bits of the address 0xh79f. The way this address works is that so long as there is a value there Mario is invincible star mario and it counts down from hex value 0x23 (35 decimal) to 0. 23 in binary is 0010 0011 meaning the max sum of these bits could 5 during 0001 1111 when the count down reaches hex value 0x1f (31 decimal).",
